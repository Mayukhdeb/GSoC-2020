Pre-trained deep neural networks like ResNet are being used in various industries where they help make our lives easier. But these kinds of models are not yet being used for microscopic images on a large scale. With the right model architecture and training approaches, it is possible to get pre-trained models which would help in the research efforts of many. These models, combined with a GUI would act as a community tool which would help speed up the classification of thousands of microscopic images and gain inferences from them.
